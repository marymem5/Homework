Two trends based on PyCity Schools:

When looking at Top Schools for overall pass rate versus bottom schools, all top schools were Charter Schools and all poor performing were district schools.

Looking at average scores per grade shows that each grade at a particular school had similar averages - there did not seem to be 
any difference between the average scores depending on grade level.

Highest level of spending per student actually had lower scores than the other three "bins" for spending.

Different sized schools did not seem to have markedly different outcomes.
